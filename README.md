# 🍄 Mushroom Classification Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to our Data Science mini-project focused on mushroom classification! This repository contains our work on developing a model to distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms.

## 🧠 Project Topic: Mushroom Classification

Our goal is to create a reliable classification system for mushrooms using machine learning techniques. This project could have real-world applications in:

- Foraging safety
- Ecological research
- Automated mushroom identification systems

## 📊 Data Source

We're using the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available on Kaggle:

[Mushroom Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)

### Dataset Details:

- This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family.
- Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.
- The dataset contains 8124 instances with 22 attributes (excluding the class attribute).

### Key Attributes(in source):

1. Cap shape
2. Cap surface
3. Cap color
4. Bruises
5. Odor
6. Gill attachment
7. Gill spacing
8. Gill size
9. Gill color
10. Stalk shape
11. Stalk root
12. Stalk surface above ring
13. Stalk surface below ring
14. Stalk color above ring
15. Stalk color below ring
16. Veil type
17. Veil color
18. Ring number
19. Ring type
20. Spore print color
21. Population
22. Habitat

## 🚀 Project Goals

1. Explore and analyze the mushroom dataset to identify key features for classification.
2. Develop and compare multiple machine learning models for mushroom classification.
3. Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing model.
4. Create visualizations to better understand the data and model results.
